## About Me

I'm a ScM Student in Biostatistics at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu" style="color:#002D72">Johns Hopkins University</a>. My research spans several areas, with a current focus on developing statistical models for meta-analysis. Under the guidance of Dr. Jessie Tong and Dr. Lifeng Lin, I am concentrating on IPD meta-regression methods and addressing publication bias. Additionally, I have a keen interest in genetics, specifically in Mendelian randomization and TWAS. My work also involves the epidemiologic analysis of musculoskeletal diseases, in collaboration with Dr. Guoqi Cai.

Outside of academia, I’m a dead hard fan of Juventus and Park Hyatt.

## Research Interests
